# Vanilla JS Login

## Authentication and Validation

In this video, we will create a form validator for a simple login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Basically, we use JS to create classes that will validate the login variables based on our needs then we will store information in the browser for authentication.

This method can be used on local browsers, web apps, and even on your server since it is all front-end code.
